# Development Workflow

## Session Start Checklist

Every session:
- [ ] Read memory-bank/activeContext.md
- [ ] Read memory-bank/progress.md
- [ ] Check current task in _docs/task-list.md
- [ ] Ask about any blockers

## Memory Bank Management

For complete Memory Bank procedures, see @memory-bank-management.mdc

**Quick Reference:**
- Read activeContext.md and progress.md FIRST every session
- Update progress.md after completing tasks
- Update activeContext.md after significant changes
- Run "update memory bank" command for full review

**Integration with Workflow:**
Memory Bank updates are part of task completion (Step 4 - Report Completion).
Don't mark task complete without updating Memory Bank.

## Execution Modes

This project supports two execution modes:

- **Manual Mode** (default): Step-by-step with user approval at each stage
- **Autonomous Mode**: Continuous execution for batch tasks (see @autonomous-execution.mdc)

The workflows below apply to **Manual Mode**. For autonomous mode, see @autonomous-execution.mdc.

## Task Execution Flow

### 1. Understand Requirements
```
Questions to answer before coding:
- What is the acceptance criteria?
- What files need to be created/modified?
- What are the dependencies?
- How will this be tested?
```

### 2. Implement with Context
```
- Reference architecture patterns
- Follow established conventions
- Add appropriate logging
- Include error handling
```

### 3. Verify Before Completion
```
- Run tests
- Check linting
- Verify builds
- Test manually if needed
```

### 4. Report Completion
```
✅ TASK COMPLETED

Task: [Task ID and Name]
Files Changed:
- [list files]

Testing:
- [what was tested]
- [results]

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Criterion 1
- [x] Criterion 2

Ready for Next: Yes/No
Blockers: [any issues]
```

### 5. Wait for Approval (Manual Mode)
```
Do NOT proceed to next task automatically.
Wait for explicit approval.

Exception: In autonomous mode (@autonomous-execution.mdc),
proceed immediately to next task after successful commit.
```

## Context Summary Creation

After completing complex/critical tasks, ASK:
```
📄 CREATE CONTEXT SUMMARY?

Task completed: [Task name]
Complexity: [Straightforward/Complex/Critical]
Suggest summary: Yes/No - [reason]

Would you like me to create a summary?
A) Yes, create it
B) No, skip for now
```

**When to recommend summaries:**
- ✅ Difficult bug fixes with non-obvious solutions
- ✅ Important architectural decisions
- ✅ Complex integrations or configurations
- ✅ Tricky algorithms or performance optimizations
- ❌ Straightforward implementations
- ❌ Simple CRUD operations

## Multi-Agent Handoff

When switching agents:
```markdown
## Handoff to [NEXT AGENT]

### Goal
[What needs to be accomplished]

### Context
[Current state]

### Completed Work
- [Specific changes]
- [Files affected]

### Open Questions
- [Issues]

### Next Agent Needs
- [Requirements]
- [Expected inputs]
```
