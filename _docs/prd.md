# **AI Video Generation Pipeline**
# **Project Overview**

You'll build a complete AI video generation pipeline that takes high-level prompts and outputs publication-ready video content with synchronized audio, coherent visuals, and professional polish.

# **MVP Requirements **

This is a hard gate. To pass the MVP checkpoint, you must have:

1. Working video generation for at least ONE category (music video OR ad creative)  
2. Basic prompt to video flow (text input to video output)  
3. Audio visual sync (video matches audio timing/beats)  
4. Multi clip composition (at least 3 to 5 clips stitched together)  
5. Consistent visual style across clips  
6. Deployed pipeline (API or web interface)  
7. Sample outputs (at least 2 generated videos demonstrating capability)

The MVP proves your pipeline works end to end. A simple but reliable music video generator beats a feature-rich system that produces incoherent output.

## **Example MVP Architecture**

At minimum, you should have:

1. Prompt Parser: Interprets user input and extracts creative direction  
2. Content Planner: Breaks video into scenes/segments with timing  
3. Generation Engine: Calls AI models (video, image, audio) for each segment  
4. Composition Layer: Stitches clips with transitions and audio sync  
5. Output Handler: Renders final video in standard format (MP4, WebM)

# **Core Pipeline Requirements**

## **Video Categories**

You must support at least ONE of these categories with full end to end generation:

### **Category 1: Music Video Pipeline**

**Input:** Song file (generated or uploaded) \+ creative direction

**Output:** Complete music video (1 to 3 minutes)

**Requirements:**

* Generate or accept AI generated music (Suno, Udio, etc.)  
* Analyze song structure (intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro)  
* Detect beats and tempo for scene transitions  
* Generate visuals that match song mood and lyrics  
* Sync visual transitions to musical beats  
* Maintain visual coherence across scenes  
* Apply consistent style/aesthetic throughout

**Example Prompts:**

* "Create an ethereal music video for this ambient electronic track with floating geometric shapes"  
* "Generate a high energy punk rock video with urban graffiti aesthetics"  
* "Make a dreamy indie pop video with pastel colors and nature scenes"

### **Category 2: Ad Creative Pipeline**

**Input:** Product description \+ brand guidelines \+ ad specifications
